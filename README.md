Interview
=========

Some code that shows my current C++ skills. It is far from perfect, but good enough to show as a prototype. 

The tar file includes all the source and test maps. Current source available here is work in progress and may not compile\work. Please use only the TAR archive for your reference. All the instructions can be found in the code comment sections. I will be updating the manuals as I go. 

Thank you for checking it out.
